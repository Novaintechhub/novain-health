runConfig:
  # The amount of memory in MiB allocated for each server instance.
  # 512 is a good starting point for most web applications.
  memoryMiB: 512

  # The number of CPUs to use for each server instance.
  # 1 CPU is standard for many workloads.
  cpu: 1

  # Minimum number of instances to keep running.
  # Setting this to 1 ensures your app is always responsive and avoids "cold starts"
  # for your first visitors. This incurs a small, constant cost.
  # For the tightest budget, you can set this to 0.
  minInstances: 1

  # Maximum number of instances to scale up to during high traffic.
  # This provides a safety net to handle unexpected visitor spikes.
  # 10 is a safe and sensible limit for a new application.
  maxInstances: 10

  # The maximum number of concurrent requests each instance can handle
  # before a new instance is started. The default of 80 is fine for most apps.
  concurrency: 80
